### BenchLarge

The evaluation results on 2000 apps from f-droid and 2000 ones from google play are given. 

- **Data Set:** Information about apps.

- **Resolution Results**: the ICC resolution results of tools, A3E, IC3, IC3-DIALDroid, Gator, StoryDistiller and ICCBot. 

- **Statistic on BenchLarge.xlsx**: statistic information, including the execution time, the evaluation results of number-based and graph-based metrics.

  

### Oracle Construction

The ICCs in our oracle set and their corresponding tags, i.e., the raw data of our ICCViewer website https://iccviewer.ldby.site/ICCViewer/.

For the five benchmarks in BenchHand, and the 31 apps in BenchSmall.



### Tags and Patterns

Count the number of tags and ICCs relates to each pattern.

- **FN-ICC-tag-count:** Number of tags on common FN ICCs.
- **All-ICC-tag-count:** Number of tags on all ICCs.
- **other files: **ICCs relates to each pattern.
